***1.About***

Whive IO, is an open-source blockchain protocol that extends the Bitcoin blockchain through enabling Trustless Rewards for Engineering Sustainable Solutions.

Building on the success of Bitcoin the World&#39;s most secure blockchain, the Whive community has set out to build a cryptographically secure blockchain protocol and Auxiliary Chain(AuxChain) that shall allow for building applications that trustlessly reward sustainable solutions.

The Whive Protocol is built with game-theory that rewards machines operating in regions in the World with high solar reliability indices(SRIs)!

Thus, the protocol shall incentivize engineers in the developing World to contribute to developing sustainable solutions to challenges facing their community using the following Engineering disciplines:

- Network Engineering
- Software Engineering
- Protocol Engineering

The Whive protocol shall be supported by a suite of software tools built to incentivize multiple third-party individuals and institutions to collaborate together to execute and achieve this vision.

The Whive protocol is designed to unlock the potential of sustainable resources such as solar energy by enabling through an incentive model the creation of distributed energy markets!

The Whive Protocol is being built, tested and deployed by a community of individuals and organizations around the World.



***2. Current Specifications***

The Whive protocol contains the following specifications:

- It is a Bitcoin Fork and Auxiliary Chain, shall utilize the Bitcoin code base to remain compatible with Bitcoin.
- The protocol shall have its Rewards generated through an optimized Proof-of-Work(PoW) consensus algorithm.
- The Reward symbol which is also the name of the wallet is WHIVE.
- The smallest unit of the Reward shall be 0.00000001 WHIVE.
- There shall be a maximum supply of 100,000,000 Rewards over a period of ~20 years(by 2040). This includes, 18,500,000+ Whive tokens which shall be claimed after the Bitcoin fork from the version 2 release of the protocol.
- The algorithm checks the processor, location, timezone and balance of all nodes attributing a higher optimization weight to nodes with higher balances, daylight threshold and desired CPU optimizations.
- The protocol shall support between 7 - 20 transactions per second on a 1 - 2 MB block-size or a Segregated Witness (SegWit) enabled block-weight of 4 MB similar to Bitcoin.
- The protocol shall over time keep up-to date with the latest Bitcoin source code updates after release of the final core features in version 3 of the protocol.
- The protocol shall support Layer 2 Protocols such as Lightning to enable fast and micro-transactions on the Whive network to ensure atomic-swap capabilities.

***3. RoadMap***

Research and Development of the The Whive protocol&#39;s core features began in 2017 and shall conclude by the end of 2021 with the following Roadmap:

- **Q2-2017,  Research &amp; Analysis:** The protocol founders identified a key problem area within the developing countries of lack of way to incentivize engineering of sustainable solutions. Such as the lack of access to sustainable energy such as solar, which is a tremendous global challenge.

- **Q3-2018, Testing GPU &amp; CPU Algorithms(Lyra, Argon and Yespower):** The protocol founders tested multiple algorithms to determine which are most suitable for the tokenization of Solar Energy capture. The Yespower algorithm was found to be the most adaptable and secure.
- **Q1-2019, Forking Bitcoin Code:** The protocol developers forked the Bitcoin Code as it has most  of the functionality needed for implementing the protocol.
- **Q2-2019, Yespower Implementation:**  The protocol developers implemented Yespower 1.0 to allow only CPU and GPU machines to be rewarded by the protocol. We want to restrict ASIC based machines from getting these rewards.
- **Q2-2019, Private Testnet:**  The protocol developers launched the private test-net for internal testing of the protocol.
- **Q3-2019, DNSSeeder setup /Nodes Setups:** The protocol developers setup the seeder to allow the Whive Network to be visible on the network.
- **Q4-2019, Yespower Time &amp; Machine optimization:** The protocol developers added Machine, Time-Zone and Processor optimization to the Yespower Implementation.
- **Q1-2020, Public Testnet:**  The protocol contributors tested the network before launch.
- **Q1-2020, Community Launches Main-net :**  The Whive Network was launched on 02/02/2020 together with the Yellow Paper for community audit and peer review.
- **Q4-2020, Protocol Upgrades:**  Protocol features shall be updated by Community Contributors with a Version 2 software release which includes increased Optimization of the Yespower algorithm, a Bitcoin UTXOs hard fork, and release of wallet for claiming Whive Rewards during the Bitcoin fork.
- **Q1-2021, Protocol V2 Release:**  Protocol features shall be released by community contributors with a Version 2 software release which includes a hard fork, Proof-of-Hodl, Optimized Rewards, and the Green-paper publication with peer-reviewed mathematical proofs by the protocol researchers.
- **Q3-2021, Protocol Complete:**  The protocol Roadmap ends for its core features and the protocol contributors voluntarily & continuously update the protocol to maintain security and compatibility as an Auxiliary chain(AuxChain) of the Bitcoin protocol.

***4. Governance***

The Whive protocol is voluntarily governed by its community of contributors. Network participants can make contributions as developers, miners, testers, trainers and users independently. Code audit and contributions shall be made via our main github repository located at[https://github.com/whiveio](https://github.com/whiveio).

The Whive protocol development and test-net deployment was initially facilitated by the BitHub Africa community of blockchain enthusiasts based in Africa. The number of the Whive protocol contributors has continued to grow to include volunteers from around the World.

Subsequently, should the network accrue enough value; the Whive protocol shall be governed by a community funded Foundation known as the **Whive Foundation** which shall be registered in a Blockchain friendly jurisdiction no later than 18 months after accruing the required economic value to setup the Foundation.

The main goal for the Foundation is to research and develop policy frameworks around use of the protocol.

The Foundation shall NOT have any control of the protocol beyond organizing the aforementioned functions.

The protocol software and network shall be deployed, run and maintained by contributors around the World as per the Whive Code of Conduct & Terms of Service.

The Whive project has a 7 year plan to achieve ubiquity for solving its key challenges.

As such the Whive Foundation shall have a bounty program that shall be used to ensure that yearly milestones are met within the planned time-frame of the project.

The Foundation will be funded by unclaimed WHIVE Rewards after the end of the snapshot period for the Bitcoin fork described in the Roadmap.

**The UNCLAIMED rewards shall be distributed as follows:**

1. 50% for the Founders/Developers of the protocol
2. 30% towards operations and maintenance of Foundation in a Legal Jurisdiction
3. 10% for Founding Contributors
4. 10% towards the Contributors

The Foundation with its allocation of unclaimed Whive rewards, shall also fund solar-powered innovations that use the Whive protocol to build Green energy solutions globally!

The Whive Community (of users) is entitled to responsibly mine, and trade their own Rewards.

The Whive Community is governed by the Whive Code of Conduct.
